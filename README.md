# TilebasedRPG-Python

This is a tile-based RPG written using the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) library. I am using this project to learn about how pygame games work and to further my game development and python skills.

I am trying to best practices with Python as well as game development in mind while developing this game.

## Next Steps 

* Implement sprites

* Implement player inventory

* Finish map swapping logic
